# ðŸŽ® Tic Tac Toe â€“ Java Game with AI and Design Patterns

A modern take on the classic Tic Tac Toe game, developed in Java using Swing. This project is designed with clean architecture and advanced OOP principles, making use of **MVC**, **Strategy**, and **Factory** design patterns. It supports both **single-player (vs AI)** and **two-player** modes with three AI difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.

---

##  Features

-  **Smart AI**: Choose from Easy (random), Medium (smart positioning), or Hard (win prediction).
-  **Two Game Modes**: Play solo against the AI or with a friend.
-  **Clean Architecture**: Fully implemented using the MVC design pattern.
-  **Flexible Player Creation**: Factory pattern used to create Human or AI players dynamically.
-  **Strategy Pattern**: AI difficulty levels implemented as interchangeable strategies.

---

##  Design Patterns Used

- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: For a clean separation of concerns.
- **Factory Pattern**: To dynamically create players based on selected mode.
- **Strategy Pattern**: To plug-and-play different AI strategies without changing core logic.
